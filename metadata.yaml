  Portainer enables centralized configuration, management and security of Kubernetes and Docker
  environments, allowing you to deliver ‘Containers-as-a-Service’ to your users quickly, easily
  and securely.

  Adopting container solutions like Kubernetes is hard. To succeed, you need to provide secure 
  access to a range of users with differing needs. Portainer solves this by allowing you to
  centrally configure, manage and secure your environment regardless of where its hosted (on prem,
  in the cloud at the edge) or what K8s distro you are using.

  Portainer allows developers to deploy and manage cloud native apps through Portainer's 
  simplified 'expert' UI, with native dashboards or through integration with industry standard
  CI/CD tools.

  Regardless of the deployment method, Portainer ensures governance and policies are applied 
  and app deployments are successful.
